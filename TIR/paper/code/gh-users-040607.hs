Hi Mike,

You might find heterogeneous lists useful.
http://www.cwi.nl/~ralf/HList/
See the treatment of your example below.

Cheers,
Ralf

import HList
import HTypeDriven
import Data.Typeable

-- These are your two "implementations".

data MyImplementation1 = MyImplementation1 Int deriving (Show,Eq,Typeable)
data MyImplementation2 = MyImplementation2 Int deriving (Show,Eq,Typeable)


-- This is your interface class and the two instances.

class MyInterface a 
 where
  foo :: a -> Int

instance MyInterface MyImplementation1
 where
  foo (MyImplementation1 i) = i

instance MyInterface MyImplementation2
 where
  foo (MyImplementation2 i) = i


-- Here is your list,
-- without the noise you don't like.

list1 =  MyImplementation1 10
     .*. MyImplementation2 20
     .*. HNil


-- If you like, this is the type, but it is not needed.
-- This list is not opaque. Less trouble in our experience.
-- (When compared to using existentials.)

type MyList =  MyImplementation1
           :*: MyImplementation2
           :*: HNil


-- Perhaps you want to make sure that you have a list of implementations
-- of MyInterface. Here is *one* way to do it. But you don't need to do it
-- because this will be automatically checked (statically) whenever you
-- try to use the fooISH interface.

class ListOfMyInterface l
 where
  listOfMyInterface :: l -> l
  listOfMyInterface = id

instance ListOfMyInterface HNil
instance ( MyInterface e
         , ListOfMyInterface l
         )
      =>   ListOfMyInterface (HCons e l)


-- So you apply the id function with the side effect of statically 
-- ensuring that you are given a list of implementations of MyInterface.

list2 :: MyList
list2 = listOfMyInterface list1


-- Here is another way to do it.
-- You apply a heterogenous fold to the list.
-- This second solution is just for fun.

data ImplementsMyInterface = ImplementsMyInterface

instance HApply ImplementsMyInterface (e,l) (HCons e l)
 where
  hApply _ (e,l) = HCons e l

myKindOfList l = hFoldr ImplementsMyInterface HNil l


-- Basically again you apply the identity function; a deep one this time.

list3 :: MyList
list3 = myKindOfList list1


-- Your equality can indeed not work because the existentially quantified
-- implementations are of course opaque. You cannot compare apples and
-- oranges. Equality of heterogeneous lists is trivial; it is just derived.
-- To make it a little bit more interesting, we can consider heterogeneous
-- or stanamic equality. So you will always get a Boolean even for lists
-- of different types. See below.


-- Here is your bar function
-- It uses one sort of maps on heterogeneous lists.

bar :: MyList -> Int
bar = sum . hMapOut Foo

data Foo = Foo -- type driver for class-level application

instance MyInterface e => HApply Foo e Int
 where
  hApply _ e = foo e


-- Yet another heterogeneous equality
-- Just for fun.
yaHEq :: (Typeable a, Typeable b, Eq a) => a -> b -> Bool
yaHEq a b = case cast b of
             Just a' -> a == a'
             Nothing -> False

-- Yet another heterogeneous list; a bit less typed.
data AnyMyInterface = forall a. ( Eq a
                                , Typeable a
                                , MyInterface a
                                ) => AnyMyInterface a

type MyList' = [AnyMyInterface]
list4 = [ AnyMyInterface $ MyImplementation1 10
        , AnyMyInterface $ MyImplementation1 10
        ]
list5 = [ AnyMyInterface $ MyImplementation1 10
        , AnyMyInterface $ MyImplementation2 10
        ]
list6 = [ AnyMyInterface $ MyImplementation1 10
        , AnyMyInterface $ MyImplementation2 20
        ]

instance Eq AnyMyInterface
 where
  (AnyMyInterface x) == (AnyMyInterface y) = x `yaHEq` y

Demo follows.

*Main> :l gh-users-040607.hs
Compiling FakePrelude      ( ./FakePrelude.hs, interpreted )
Compiling HType            ( HType.hs, interpreted )
Compiling HList            ( ./HList.hs, interpreted )
Compiling HArray           ( ./HArray.hs, interpreted )
Compiling HTypeDriven      ( ./HTypeDriven.hs, interpreted )
Compiling Main             ( gh-users-040607.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main, HTypeDriven, HArray, HList, HType, FakePrelude.
*Main> list1
HCons (MyImplementation1 10) (HCons (MyImplementation2 20) HNil)
*Main> bar list1
30
*Main> list1 == list1
True
*Main> list1 `hEqList` hReverse list1
False
*Main> list4!!0 == list4!!1
True
*Main> list5!!0 == list5!!1
False
*Main> list6!!0 == list6!!1
False
