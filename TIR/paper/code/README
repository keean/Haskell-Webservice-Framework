Code for the paper "Strongly typed heterogeneous collections"

Disclaimer: prepared for use with GHC (tested with GHC version 6.2).
We provide the code as shown in the paper for the reader's
convenience. We plan to release the HList library as time permits.
Our intention is to contribute the HList library to the Haskell
libraries project. The code from the database section is not included
because we are still working on the database access library and the
underlying infrastructure.
