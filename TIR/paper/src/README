The HList library and samples

This distribution covers all esential issues discussed in the HList paper.
Additional examples and HList operations are provided.
The code from the database section of the HList paper is not included
since doing so would have implied inclusion of substantial packages,
namely the underlying infrastructure for database access library.

The code works --- within the limits exercised in the source files ---
for both GHC (6.4) and Hugs (Nov 2003). See the Makefile for ways of
running test cases.

One may run "make test" to check the distribution.
