  abstract =     "We investigate a technique from the literature, called
                 the phantom types technique, that uses parametric
                 polymorphism, type constraints, and unification of
                 polymorphic types to model a subtyping hierarchy.
                 Hindley-Milner type systems, such as the one found in
                 SML, can be used to enforce the subtyping relation. We
                 show that this technique can be used to encode any
                 finite subtyping hierarchy (including hierarchies
                 arising from multiple interface inheritance). We
                 formally demonstrate the suitability of the phantom
                 types technique for capturing subtyping by exhibiting a
                 type-preserving translation from a simple calculus with
                 bounded polymorphism to a calculus embodying the type
                 system of SML. We then illustrate a particular use of
                 the technique to capture programming invariants
                 associated with user-defined datatypes, in the form of
                 statically-enforced datatype specializations.",

  abstract = {Dynamic binding denotes a runtime lookup operation which
    extracts values corresponding to some ``names'' from some
    ``environments'' (finite, unordered associations of names and
    values). Many situations related with flexible software assembly
    involve dynamic binding: first-class modules, mobile code,
    object-oriented message passing. This paper proposes a compact
    extension of the lambda-calculus to model dynamic binding, where variables
    are labelled by names, and where arguments are passed to functions
    along named channels.  The resulting formalism preserves familiar
    properties of the lambda-calculus, has a Curry-styletype inference system,
    and has a formal notion of compatibility for reasoning about extensible
    environments. It can encode record and record extensions, as well
    as first-class contexts with context-filling operations, and
    therefore provides a basic framework for expressing awide range of
    name-based coordination mechanisms.  },
